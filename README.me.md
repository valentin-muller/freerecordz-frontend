# FREERECORDZ

## Description

The FREERECORDZ app is a music discovery app which helps users to discover completely new music while at the same time enabling them to listen to music they saved previously. On the contrary to other existing streaming apps, the app will not contain already known music or artists. The artists who upload to Streaming are new and unknown, and the application will help them to become discovered.

In functionality, the app is no different than any other streaming.
 The homepage contains top lists, such as daily top list, weekly top list and a monthly top list, along with some featured musicians.

Naturally, there is a page with the library of previously saved music, where the users can see music they saved, along with any playlists that they created, just like with any other streaming app.

The main function and the page of the app is the **discovery page.** It is a function that the app is built around. By clicking on discover, the app shows a page with two options. 

By clicking on the **random discovery,** the app will automatically play a playlist made up of 10 songs which are randomly selected from the database. These are the songs that have never been heard by the specific user.

The second option on the discovery page is to specify what kind of music to discover. If this type of discovery is selected, a new page will show. This page is the most important, as here the listener is able to select: -genres of the music, -gender of the performer, -language of the song, -country of the performer/band, etc. After selecting, the user can click on the create button and a playlist will be created of 10 random songs according to the selected criteria. 

 When a song is being played, on the song screen, users can like or dislike it, save it to their library, besides the typical, play/pause and skip functions.

## Models
While uploading the music, an artist user will have to define categories for each song that will be written in the database and on those criteria the search option will be able to find songs that match the criteria defined by the listener. This is the most important function of the app, for the users to be able to find music based on the search categories.
